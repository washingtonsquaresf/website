# Website Backup Project

This repository serves as a backup of a website originally hosted on GoDaddy. Due to hosting limitations, direct code export was not possible, so all content has been preserved and organized manually.

## Contents

The project is structured as follows:

### üì∏ `screenshots/`
- Full-page screenshots of the entire website

### üñºÔ∏è `images/`
- All images used throughout the website
- Organized by the section/page they belong to

### üìù `website_text.md`
- A markdown file containing all the textual content from the website
- Structured to match the original sections for easy reference

## GitHub Account Info

- **Username:** `chadweidmer@gmail.com`
- *(Password not included here for security reasons)*

## Purpose

This backup ensures that all content from the original website is retained and accessible for:
- Future site migrations
- Redevelopment or redesign work
- Reference or archiving

## Notes

- This repository **does not contain source code** (HTML/CSS/JS) as it was not accessible from the hosting provider.
- All content is organized manually to mirror the structure of the original website.

## Next Steps

- Convert this archive into a static website (optional)
- Rebuild the website in your preferred platform (e.g., React, WordPress, etc.)
- Use the provided assets for marketing or documentation purposes
